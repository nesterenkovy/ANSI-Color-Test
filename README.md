# ANSI-Color-Test
Simple test displaying the 16-color ANSI palette in terminal emulators.

## Motivation
The project was born out of the need to visualize the basic 16-color ANSI code tables in a simple and user-friendly way.

While there are similar tools and scripts available online, such as the [Bash-Prompt-HOWTO](https://tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prompt-HOWTO/x329.html) and [F-ANSI - Java Colored Output](https://github.com/dimo414/f-ansi), none of them fully met the basic requirements.

## Features
* Default two color mapping lists: alternating brightness and separate dark and bright;
* Visualizes the effect of a reverse attribute;
* Easy custom configuration of color lists;
* Customization of column separator and cell filler.

## Requirements
* PowerShell or BASH â€” use the appropriate script

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Go to the scripts folder corresponding to your shell.
3. Run the script or program in your terminal emulator.
4. If you need a different order of displaying colors, make the appropriate changes in the script.
